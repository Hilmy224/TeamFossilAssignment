## GameMakerLangauge Project

### Todos
```
+ Sticky Collssion with the walls (still cant figure it out)
+ Un Sync Sprite animtions between Objects
+ Actually make the game mechanic T-T
```

### Lesson Learned
This the first platformer, I have tried to make using gamemaker. In previous time I have tried to familirize myself with the tools that are preety diffrent compared to what I use from godot. For the things I would do over are
+ SpriteSheet -> Standardize sprite sheet, the problem was I hastily put every sprite into one image without much consideration between resoultion so that became a problem during the tiling process
+ GM Visual -> I did'nt fully make use of this, a strong part of this in this project because i was to used to code based logic handling
+ Set Up Workflow -> This might be more of a skill issue but going back I want to try making more generic colliision and area detection boxes and layering (this again because I was to used to godots version and dont' quite know if theres an easier work around)
